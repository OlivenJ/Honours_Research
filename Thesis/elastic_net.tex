	\section{Elastic Net}\label{Elastic_Net}

Elastic net  is variable selection model that can be used for factor selection, introduced by \citeA{Zou2005}. Applying the elastic net method to estimate the factor loading $\beta_{ij}$ requires:
	\[   \hat{\beta}_{ij}  = \argmin_{\beta_{ij}}\{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}[(r_{it} - r_{ft}) - \beta_{ij }f_{jt}]^2 + \lambda_2\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\beta_{ij}^2  + \lambda_1\sum_{i = 1}^{n}|\beta_{ij}|  \label{ENcriterion} \tag{4}   \}    \]
	
	
	
Because the Lasso regression only contains $L_1$ penalty term $\sum_{i = 1}^{n} |\beta_{ij}|$, it will shows no preference when selecting variables when they are highly correlated.
So when Lasso regression will either randomly choose factors from highly correlated candidates, or eliminate them together as a whole.  
Elastic Net, however, by containing $L_2$ penalty term $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\beta_{ij}^2$, solves this problem. 
The $L_2$ penalty term tend to shrink the potential parameters when they does not provide enough explanatory power, but it will not remove redundant factors.
Therefore, the elastic net method will shrink those parameters associated with the correlated factors and keep them, or drop them if they are redundant at pricing risk.
