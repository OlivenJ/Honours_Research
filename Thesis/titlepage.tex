\chapter*{Abstract}
	\textbf{Delete before submit: Remember what to include in the abstract: The identification of this paper, what this paper did, why we did so, what we found, and what are the meaning of those findings.}\\
In this paper, we applied one new concept called factor strength to categorised the risk factors of CAPM model and applied a machine learning model called Elastic net to investigates the problem of how to select risk factors fro multi-factor CAPM model.\\
The high dimensions of factor groups increase the computational burden when applying the variable selecting algorithm, and a common feature of high-dimension factor group is that the correlation is pervasive therefore some selecting method is no longer appropriate in that scenario.\\
The factors strength helps to reduce the dimensionality of the candidates' factor group and provides a guideline to evaluates the performance of our factor selecting methods.\\
The Elastic net technique provides a potential solution for identifying factors and reducing redundant factors when constructing factor models.
In brief, we find that the elastic net working effectively concerning reducing the redundancy in the factor groups.\\
This result proves the feasibility of applying Elastic net algorithm on selecting the risk factor for the CAPM model.  \\
 \textbf{Keywords}: CAPM, Factor Model, Factor Strength, Elastic Net, Lasso
