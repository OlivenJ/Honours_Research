	\section{Conclusion}\label{Conclusion}
In this thesis, we proposed the concept of factor strength and the corresponding estimation method to a set of 145 risk factors plus the market factors.
We also applied the method of Elastic net and Lasso regression to conduct feature selection to 145 risk factors, to realisation the idea of factor selection 



When deciding the tuning parameter $\theta$ and $\phi$ of the elastic net.
Rather than using MSE, the researchers may consider to use other criterion for example the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
An potential extension of this project is to categorised both the companies and the factors into subgroups base on their properties.
For instance, future research can investigates the factor selection behaviours of companies in different industries, or factors capture risk from different prospects.
Future research can also pay attention on the method of estimated factor strength.
